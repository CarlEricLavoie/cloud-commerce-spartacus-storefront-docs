title: Applying Coupon (DRAFT)
---

Customers apply coupons to their orders in the cart page. Coupons are applied by entering coupon codes in the **Coupon** field and then clicking the **Apply** button. The coupons are represented by a box with the coupon codes below the **Coupon** field, and the applied coupon codes are displayed in the **Order Summary** section. Customers can remove the coupons by clicking **Remove** in the coupon box.

The following screenshot shows the **WINTER19** coupon successfully applied to a cart, giving a $10 discount on the order:

Once a coupon is applied to the current cart, the coupon code is also viewable in the checkout step pages, the order confirmation page, and the order details page.

Note the following when using coupons:

- The **Apply** button is disabled if the customer does not input anything in the **Coupon** field.
- If the coupon code is invalid, an error message will display after clicking **Apply**.
- After a coupon is applied to the cart, the cart total will be recalculated, and the applied coupon is viewable in the **Order Summary** section. The applied coupon list displays below the **Coupon** field.
- After a coupon is removed from the cart, the cart total will be recalculated, and this coupon will neither display in the **Order Summary** section, or below the **Coupon** field. 
- A link is viewable at the bottom of the **Order Summary** section, which indicates the coupons the current customer owns when no coupon has been applied, or the number of coupons that have been applied. Clicking the link directs the customer to the coupon input box, allowing him or her to either apply a coupon or manage the applied coupons.
