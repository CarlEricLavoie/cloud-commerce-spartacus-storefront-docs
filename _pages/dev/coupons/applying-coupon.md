title: Applying Coupon (DRAFT)
---

Customers apply coupons to their orders during checkout. Coupons are applied by entering the case-sensitive coupon code in the **Coupon** field and then clicking the **Apply** button. The coupon is represented by a box with the coupon name below the **Coupon** field, and the discount amount is displayed in the **Order Summary** section. Customers can remove the coupon by clicking **Remove** in the coupon box.

The following screenshot shows the **WINTER19** coupon successfully applied to a cart, giving a $10 discount on the order:

Once a coupon is applied to the current cart, the coupon code and discount amount are also viewable in the checkout step pages, the order confirmation page, and the order details page.

Note the following when using coupons:

- The **Apply** button is disabled if the customer does not input anything in the **Coupon** field.
- If the coupon code is invalid, an error message will display after clicking **Apply**.
- After a coupon is applied to the cart, the cart total will be recalculated, and the applied coupon is viewable in the **Order Summary** section. The applied coupon list displays below the **Coupon** field, with the newly added coupon on top.
- After a coupon is removed from the cart, the cart total will be recalculated, and this coupon will neither display in the **Order Summary** section, or below the **Coupon** field. 
- If there are other promotions or coupons applied on the cart, the discount amount shows the combined discount of all coupons and promotions.
- A link is viewable at the bottom of the **Order Summary** section, which indicates the number of coupons the current customer has, or has applied. Clicking the link redirects the customer to the coupon input box, allowing him or her to either apply a coupon or manage the applied coupons.
