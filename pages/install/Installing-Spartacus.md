title: Installing Spartacus
---

The installation instructions provided here allow you to set up a Spartacus-based project with SAP Commerce Cloud.

If you are just getting started with Spartacus, or in general, if you are building a storefront application from published Spartacus libraries, see [[Building the Spartacus Storefront from Libraries]]. This guide provides step-by-step instructions on how to build a Spartacus-based storefront using the Spartacus libraries.

If you are building the Spartacus project from source, see [[Contributor Setup]]. Unless you are contributing to the Spartacus project, however, we strongly recommend that you build your storefront using the Spartacus libraries. Doing so will allow you to easily upgrade to the newest Spartacus releases.
