### Release 1.0.0 - aiming for Q2 2019 / Mid-June

As of this writing

- Spartacus is currently in 'alpha' status - this means we are still adding features
- We plan to go to 'beta' in late May, exact date to be determined, probably May 22; when we move to beta, it means that we are no longer adding features or making architectural changes that will cause upgrade issues
- The first release (1.0) is planned towards mid-June, a few weeks after the scheduled release-to-customers of SAP Commerce Cloud 1905
- To be able to use all functionality in Spartacus 1.0, SAP Commerce Cloud 1905 is required; most of Spartacus can work with 1811 and previous releases, with no guarantees the farther back you go. Specifically, the following features require 1905:
  - SmartEdit support
  - Any usage of  new CmsFlexComponents or SiteContextComponent (although you can use other components such as JspComponent)
  - Forgot password / reset
- We usually release new libraries every 2 weeks (hosted on npmjs.com)

### How Spartacus is Versioned

Spartacus is following semantic versioning (Major.Minor.Patch).

- A new patch release (1.2.3 > 1.2.4 for example) means we added fixes or small improvements but no new features.
- A new minor release (1.2.4 > 1.3.0 for example)  means we added a new feature and possibly fixes and improvements.

For both patch and minor releases, upgrading to the new libraries should not cause any compatibility problems with your storefront app. If anything, a new feature might have to be turned off because you don't wish to use it. We hope you will upgrade frequently.

- A new major release (1.3.2 > 2.0.0 for example) means that, besides adding new features and improvements, we made changes that will likely cause compatibility issues. Your app likely needs updating when moving to a new major release. These effects, reasons, and benefits will be documented.

We don't plan to introduce a new major release for at least six months (end of 2019) if not later. The release of Angular Ivy (after Angular 8) is one factor in our eventual decision to do so.



### What's Coming after 1.0

We plan to release updates to the Spartacus libraries every 2 weeks.

Besides bug fixes and continuous improvement to user experience and performance, the following features are part of our roadmap *(with obligatory reminder about forward-looking statements and plans change over time)*.
