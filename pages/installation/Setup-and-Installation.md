# Setup and Installation

If you're just getting started, see the document [[Building the Spartacus Storefront from Libraries]], which demonstrates step-by-step how to build a Spartacus-based storefront using the Spartacus libraries.

To build the Spartacus project from source, see [[Contributor Setup]]. However, unless you are contributing to the Spartacus project, we strongly recommend that you build your storefront using the Spartacus libraries. Doing so will allow you to easily upgrade to the newest Spartacus releases.
