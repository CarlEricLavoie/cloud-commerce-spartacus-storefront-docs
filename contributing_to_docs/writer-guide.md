# Writers: Contributing to Documentation

The [Spartacus documentation website](https://sap.github.io/cloud-commerce-spartacus-storefront-docs/) is hosted in GitHub Pages and is powered by Jekyll.

All documentation for Spartacus resides in the `_pages` folder that is located in the root of this repository.

The following sections are intended to help you get up-and-running with everything you need to start contributing to the Spartacus documentation repository.

## Working with Visual Studio Code

Visual Studio Code (VS Code) is an open-source code editing tool that is highly recommended for anyone who wishes to contribute to the Spartacus project. You can download it for free here: https://code.visualstudio.com

VS Code has a built-in interfaces for committing code and running commands, as well as for navigating the files in the repository, not to mention primarily being a text editor for your documents that also allows you to preview how your [markdown](#working-with-markdown) pages will render.


## Working with Markdown


## Working with Jekyll


**Note:** You must always run the Jekyll build in your branch before you merge


## Working with GitHub

- Need GitHub ID
- Need to be get write access to repos
- Need to clone the docs repo
- Working with GitHub Issues
- Procedure for adding/updating content must include a step where the writer runs a Jekyll build in their branch, and verifies it locally (http://localhost:4000/) **before** merging to `develop` or `master`.
- Every merge to the `master` branch automatically triggers Jekyll to rebuilt the site. Note that, after merging to the `master` branch, it can sometimes take a few minutes for your changes to appear.
